The Primail plugin allows you to connect your WordPress site with Mandrill for improved email delivery and reliability

== Description ==

By default, WordPress uses PHP Mail to send its emails. If you are reading this, you probably know that this isn't a perfect solution. Some hosting providers put a limit on the amount of emails that they can process, and there is no log's or records of emails once they are sent.

This plugin automatically handles redirecting emails that are normally sent by WordPress to Mandrill instead. Headers, Attachments, Content Type .etc are all automatically handled. There is minimal setup involved. Simply add your Mandrill API Key and your 'From Name' and 'EMail' and your good to go.

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New'
2. Search for 'Primail'
3. Activate the plugin from your Plugins page
